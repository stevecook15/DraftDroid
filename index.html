       <h1>Welcome to DraftDroid 2016</h1>
       <p></p>
       
       <p>Ideally this app is friendly enough to use without help but just 
       in case...</p>
       
       <h2>Main Screen</h2><p></p>
       <p><img src='dd_main_screen.png' /></p>
       
       <p>This screen handles all the selection of players by you and by your 
       opponents. The other screens are for additional information 
       and league point configuration. You select a potential player 
       by clicking on his name in the scrollable list.  Additional 
       details for that player appear at the bottom of the screen,
       including a strength of schedule indicator that player/team/position
       (Green - easy, Red - hard, Blue - bye week.</p>
       
       <p>You can 'Mark' players you're interested in prior to the draft.
       If you wish to add the selected player to your team 
       press the 'Select' button.  When a league opponent selects a 
       player press the 'Delete' button to remove him from consideration.</p>
       
       <p>In case of an mistaken selection 
       click on 'Selected' in the Display radio button list, select 
       player and click restore. Player will be removed from either your 
       team or from the selected list, as appropriate. Select another player 
       position radio button to view any particular position.</p>
       
       <p>The players lists values are based on last years statistics. The 
       list sortable by selecting the column headers. Details of whether they're 
       in the final year of their contract (CY) or on a new team (TM) are displayed 
       in the Misc column</p>
       
       <p>Some players/rookies who did not play last year may have 2015 estimated stats or
       just 2016 projections. Rel Points are a relative measure of a player 
       to a player of a different type (i.e. QB vs WR). While a QB may score 
       more total points, the WR may be more valuable in respect to the 
       other remaining WRs (i.e. better grab him while you can!)</p>
       
       <p>Enter text into the search field to filter list down to players whose 
       names contain the entered text (e.g. 'eyton').  Delete chars to restore list.</p>
       
       <p>The 2015 and 2016 (Proj) radio buttons display either last years statistics and equivalent points or
       the 2016 season projected statistics. The 'Rel Pts' field maps to the selected year</p>
       
       <p>The microphone toggle button turns on/off Text To Speech (TTS) mode. TTS will annunciate 
       supported DraftDroid events like selecting or deleting players.  If your device supports it a beta
       version of Speech To Text (STT) is available.  If the 'speech bubble' button appears next to the TTS
       button your device supports STT.  You click on the button and say a command.  Do to the nature of Android
       speech API the mode goes off after each command.  Supported commands are:<br>
       <ul>
       <li>Select 'player name',  e.g. Select Joe Smith</li>
       <li>Delete 'player name'</li>
       <li>Restore 'player name'</li>
       <li>Mark 'player name'</li>
       <li>Unmark 'player name'</li>
       <li>Notes 'player name'</li>
       <li>Show team  (shows current team players)</li>
       <li>Show stats  (shows current team statistics)</li>
       <li>Show schedule  (shows NFL schedule)</li>
       <li>Show config  (shows league configuration screen)</li>
       <li>Show help  (shows help screen)</li>
       </ul>
       </p>
       
       <p>The Display radio button list allows selection of players by 
       position, marked players, all grouped together, or a list of already selected players.</p>
       
       <p>The Byes column is a visual aid as to whether your team might have 
       lineup issues during the bye periods. Green indicates you're good, 
       yellow indicates one player short for that position, red two or more, 
       or you haven't selected any players for that position yet.</p>
       
       <p>The 'Reset' button will return the system to the start, clearing all 
       selected players and resetting the point configuration. It does not clear the marked indicator.</p>
       
       <p></p><h2>Configuration Screen</h2><p></p>
       <p><img src='dd_config.png' /></p>
       <p>This screen allows configuration of the tool to your leagues point 
       system.  This may change the order and points of players in the main screen. 
       It most likely doesn't cover every leagues point system but should still 
       provide basic scoring values. The tool doesn't support individual defensive 
       players at this time. Click on fields, enter value and select 'Save' when done.<p>
       
       <p></p><h2>My Team Screen</h2><p></p>
       <p><img src='dd_team.png' /></p>
       <p>Displays a scrollable list of players currently on your team and more 
       complete list of statistics. Also details number of players of each 
       on your team and how many players each week you have on bye.</p>
       
       <p></p><h2>Team Stats Screen</h2><p></p>
       <p><img src='dd_best.png' /></p>
       <p>Calculates what your expected best lineup would be and average points 
       scored each week.  At this point it follows a 1 QB, 2/3 RB/WR, 1 TE 
       1 KR and 1 DEF system. In future it will work based on team values set 
       in the configuration screen</p>
       
       <p></p><h2>Schedule Screen</h2><p></p>
       <p><img src='dd_schedule.png' /></p>
       <p>This screen just details each teams home/away schedule with bye 
       weeks highlighted.</p>
       
       <p>Suggestions are welcome (complaints not so much, it's free after all).
       Planned improvements include supporting multiple fantasy teams, tracking 
       opponents teams, adding additional statistical measures, voice input, etc... </p>
